## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock1.png" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">

Hi! I'm Anabel. I am a current masters student in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I graduated with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Biology at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I am interested in statistical machine learning, proteomics and computational biology!

I have a strong background in biochemistry, statistical modelling and machine learning, with my Bachelor's thesis on evaluation of false disocvery rate approaches in large-scale proteomics data, which I attained a First Class for. For more details, see my previous [below](#previous-work).

My hobbies include swimming and making hotpot! 

## Research Interests
<!-- TODO: Links to interesting papers -->
- Geometric Deep Learning in Drug Discovery
- Computational Biology (proteomics, structural bioinformatics)
- Mathematical Biology, specifically Stochastic Optimisation in modelling biochemical networks
- Statistical Machine Learning

## Research Experiences

**Computational Biologist @ University of Edinburgh, under supervision of [Professor Georg Kustatscher]**(https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/wcb/research/research-group-leaders/georg-kustatscher) and Matthew The, Technical University of Munich
- Optimised data preprocessing tool for combining multiple large-scale MaxQuant searches on protein group-level [pgFDR](https://github.com/kusterlab/picked_group_fdr), which let to discovering 7000+ novel microproteins
- Implemented this tool for accurate & sensitive protein group FDR method on MaxQuant and Fragpipe database
outputs with protein isoforms on ProteomeHD2 dataset curated by Professor Georg Kustatscher
- Controlled false discovery rate for feature selection in human MS-based proteomics dataset (size: 27.1 Gb)

**Statistical Geneticist @ UCL Centre of Computational Biology, under supervision of [Professor ZiHeng Yang and Tomas Fluori]**(http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/)
- Developed statistical models for predictive phylogenetic analysis on blood allele frequencies provided in a small
dataset.
- Implemented Bayesian MCMC algorithm to sample probability distributions in p, q, and r frequencies from
Hardy-Weinberg principle.

**Mathematical Biologist @ Centre for Systems Biology Edinburgh, under supervision of [Professor Ramon Grima]**(https://grimagroup.bio.ed.ac.uk/ramon-grima)
- Developed stochastic models (stochastic simulation algorithm) & deterministic models to analyse and predict
complex data patterns in mRNA decay biochemical kinetics.
- Conducted extensive research in Continuous Time Markov Chain processes for sampling functional Kolmogorov
Forward Equations (chemical Master Equation).
- Applied Gibbs sampling (MCMC) and Metropolis Hastings algorithm to investigate consistent genes in the
bipartite network
