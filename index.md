## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock1.png">

Hi! I'm Anabel. I hold a Masters in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I graduated with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Biochemistry at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I am interested in statistical machine learning, proteomics and computational biology! Currently working on developing a novel Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization method for molecular optimization !

I have a strong background in biochemistry, statistical modelling and machine learning, with my Bachelor's thesis on evaluation of false discovery rate approaches in large-scale proteomics data, which I attained a First Class for. For more details, see my previous work here [below](## Previous work (View Projects for Softwares and Tools Utilized)).

## Current Work
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ [IgnotaLabs.AI](https://ignotalabs.ai/)**
- under supervision by [Brooks Paige, UCL](https://tbrx.github.io/) and [Austin Tripp, University of Cambridge](https://www.austintripp.ca/)
- Benchmarking current generative AI models for practical molecular optimization [PMO Benchmarks](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/mol_opt)
- Developing a novel Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization method modelling each molecular property independently using Tanimoto Kernel GPs 
- Working on Tanimoto Kernel methods to handle molecular fingerprints and multi-objective optimization problems such as Expected Hypervolume Improvement

## Industry Experience
**Part-time Data Scientist @ [SAINS Kuching, Malaysia](https://www.sains.com.my/) (June 2023)**
- Deployed supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifiers and Logistic Regression, to predict consumer behaviors in pharmaceutical companies

**Data Science Intern @ [Graphcore, London, United Kingdom](https://www.graphcore.ai/) (June 2022)**
- Implemented A/B testing models, specifically multivariate A/B tests, to compare and evaluate different IPU-powered generative models tailored to dynamics of consumer markets for laboratory automation.
