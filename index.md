## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock1.png">

Hi! I'm Anabel. I hold a Masters in Computational Statistics & Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I graduated with 1st Class  Honours in Mathematics & Biochemistry at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). 

I am interested in statistical machine learning and machine learning for drug discovery! Current specific machine learning interests include meta learning, gaussian processes and multi-objective bayesian optimization methods. 

For more details about me, click on my **resume (updated as of October 2023).**

## Current Work
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ [IgnotaLabs.AI](https://ignotalabs.ai/)**
- under supervision by [Brooks Paige, UCL](https://tbrx.github.io/) and [Austin Tripp, University of Cambridge](https://www.austintripp.ca/)
- Benchmarking current generative AI models for practical molecular optimization [PMO Benchmarks](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/mol_opt)
- Developing a novel Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization algorithm modelling each molecular property independently using Tanimoto Kernel GPs 
- Working on Tanimoto Kernel methods to handle molecular fingerprints and multi-objective optimization problems such as Expected Hypervolume Improvement

## Industry Experience
**Part-time Data Scientist @ [SAINS Kuching, Malaysia](https://www.sains.com.my/) (June 2023)**
- Deployed supervised learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifiers and Logistic Regression, to predict consumer behaviors in pharmaceutical companies
